\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
We explore the classic nonlinear controls problem, inverting a pendulum, using analyses learned in this class. Specifically, we look at using a flywheel to stabilize the pendulum. We build a physical system from scratch. In simulation, we derive the equations of motion and apply LQR and region of attraction analyses for our system. We additionally perform controllability analysis to the case where the full state may not be measurable, as happened in our physical system. In hardware, we successfully implement downward stabilization and swingup controls using both a PD controller an a bang-bang controller. We discuss the design decisions, design iterations, and present work toward implementing a controller for the inverted state.

\section{LQR Analysis}

\subsection{Equations of Motion}

To derive the equations of motion (EOM), we use the Lagrangian method. Let $L$
equal to the kinetic energy plus the potential energy of the system.


\begin{align}
    L = KE - PE
\end{align}

By Lagrange's method,

\begin{align}
    \frac{d}{dt} (\frac{\partial{L}}{\partial \dot{q}_i}) -
    \frac{\partial{L}}{\partial q_i}  &= \sum_{i=0}^{n} F_i
\end{align}

for $i = 1,2,3 ... n $ forces.

Thus, we need to write out the KE, the PE, the derivative of L with respective
to each state $q$, the derivative of L with respect to the (time) derivative of
each state $q$, and then the time derivative of that last term.

Let us first consider the unaltered case, from the problem set, where here we
will derive the equations of motion by hand but otherwise simply explain the
derivation in detail. Later, we will consider a system that more closely matches
our real-life system. We will not be able to compare the model with reality,
since we were unable to implement the full state measurement so LQR cannot
apply. Instead, we show another example as applied to a modified system where
the reaction wheel pendulum is put on an (unpowered) cart.


1) Write the KE of the system. We can decompose this into the translational and
rotational components.

Let us consider (abstractly) the translational KE of a point mass $m$ rotating
around the origin on a massless string of length $l$. $\theta$ is defined as
angle from the downward vertical point, increasing counterclockwise  (diagram not provided).
The position of the point mass is $x = l cos \theta$ and $y = l sin \theta$.
KE is $\frac{1}{2} m \cdot q^2$, where q is the position.

% http://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/underactuated.html?chapter=multibody
\begin{align}
    KE_x &= 0.5 m (l \cdot \frac{d}{dt} \sin \theta)^2 = \frac{1}{2} m (l \dot\theta \cos \theta)^2 \\
    KE_y &= 0.5 m (l \cdot \frac{d}{dt} \cos \theta)^2  = \frac{1}{2} m (- l \dot\theta \sin\theta)^2 \\
    KE &= KE_x + KE_y = \frac{1}{2} m l^2 \dot \theta^2 (\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta) \\
       &= \frac{1}{2} m l^2 \dot\theta^2 \\
\end{align}

where on the last step we used the trig identity $\cos^2 + sin^2 = 1$.

Now applying this to the stick and flywheel components of our system, we
calculate 1) the stick around the origin 2) the flywheel around the origin. Note
that the KE of the stick acts at $l_1$, the center-of-mass of the stick, not
$l_2$.

\begin{align}
    KE_{\text{translational}} &= \frac{1}{2} m_1 (l_1 \dot\theta_1)^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 (l_2 \dot\theta_1)^2\\
\end{align}

Additionally we have the inertial component of KE since we have angular
velocities here and our stick has mass and our previous point mass is instead a rotating
flywheel. The general formula is $KE = \frac{1}{2} I_2 \dot\theta^2$.
Noting that angular velocities "add", and applying this to each component of our
system; we calculate 1) inertial KE of the stick 2) inertial KE of the flywheel.

\begin{align}
    KE_{\text{inertial}} &= \frac{1}{2} m_1 (I_1 \dot\theta_1)^2 + \frac{1}{2}
    m_2 (I_2 (\dot\theta_1 + \dot\theta_2))^2\\
\end{align}

The total KE of the system is the sum of the above.

2) The potential energy (PE) of the system is more straightforward. Gravitationally
speaking, (and with a bit of geometry - note that our theta is defined from
vertical and increasing counterclockwise)

\begin{align}
    PE &= m_1 g (1 - l_1 \cos\theta_1) + m_2 g (1 - l_2 \cos\theta_1)
\end{align}

3) Now we have the lagrangian $L = KE - PE$ and must take the partial of the lagrangian with
respect to each state variable, in our case $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$.

Using sympy, we calculate
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} =  BLAH
\end{align}

4) We also calculate the
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot q_i} =  BLAH
\end{align}

5) Finally, we calculate the time derivative of the last term
\begin{align}
    \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot q_i} =  BLAH
\end{align}

6) Subtracting, we set the equation equal to our input torque.

TODO %TODO.

This gives us our final manipulator equations.

%\subsubsection{Motor vs Gravity}

%Tangentially, ideally our output torque is enough to fight gravity and
%essentially "hold" the pendulum floating in space at any angle, and the maximum
%torque is at horizontal ( $\theta_1 = \pi/2$ ).

%\begin{align}
    %\tau_{motor, max} &= 270 \; \text{Nm} \\
%\tau_{gravity, max} &= m g l sin\theta \\
%\tau_{gravity, max} &= m_{system} \cdot 9.8 \cdot 0.021 \cdot sin(\pi/2)\\
%\tau_{gravity, max} &= (.546 + .45 + .115/2 ) \cdot 9.8 \cdot 0.021 \cdot 1\\
%\tau_{gravity, max} &\approx .21 \; \text{Nm}
%\end{align}

%Where for back-of-envelope purposes we're approximating torque contribution of
%the stick.

%Here we easily see that our output torque does not approach this. A more
%useful analysis is to observe whether
%conservation of energy, we can conclude that for a closed system,

\subsection{Find the Fixed Points}

To find the fixed points of the system, we calculate $\dot q s.t. f(\dot q) = 0$

\subsection{Linearization Around Fixed Point}

We can further use sympy to linearize our fixed points.

        $m_{flywheel}$ & 546 g\\
        $m_{motor}$ & 450 g \\ % TODO: estimated
        $l_{stick} = l_2$ & 21 cm \\
        $r_{flywheel}$ & 8.5 cm \\ % TODO: estimated
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{K values}

Now we simply supply a cost function. We care a lot about the $\theta_1$, some about
the $\dot\theta_1$, a bit about $\dot\theta_2$, and not at all about $\theta_2$.

\begin{align}
    Q &= 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        x_{11}       & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & x_{22} & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & x_{22} & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & x_{22} 
    \end{bmatrix}, R = \begin{bmatrix} x_{11}  \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

Plugging into the LQR function in Drake, we get the K values of :

\section{LQR for "System on Wheels"}

For a detour (in order to demonstrate understanding of the problem set material)
we imagine sticking the whole thing on wheels and redo the same analysis,
although for sanity we run the calculations through sympy instead of by hand.


\subsection{Controllability}

We begin by analyzing the controllability of the system. At an intuitive level,
we see that we've added a state (the x position of the cart) without adding any
control inputs (we can still only control the flywheel directly). We might
expect that we can still stabilize the system, but cannot control the cart
position while keeping the pendulum upright (at least with LQR feedback).

To check our intuition, we check the rank of the controllability matrix, defined as

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
