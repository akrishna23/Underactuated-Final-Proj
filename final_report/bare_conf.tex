% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***

\begin{abstract}
We explore the classic nonlinear controls problem, inverting a pendulum, using analyses learned in this class. Specifically, we look at using a flywheel to stabilize the pendulum. We build a physical system from scratch. In simulation, we derive the equations of motion and apply LQR and region of attraction analyses for our system. We additionally perform controllability analysis to the case where the full state may not be measurable, as happened in our physical system. In hardware, we successfully implement downward stabilization and swingup controls using both a PD controller an a bang-bang controller. We discuss the design decisions, design iterations, and present work toward implementing a controller for the inverted state.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
The inverted pendulum problem is one that has been widely explored in robotics and control theory. In this project, we control a single-link pendulum using a torque-controlled inertial wheel. We tackle the problems of stabilizing at the bottom (0 deg) and swinging up to stabilize at the top (180 deg). \\ \indent
While many have worked on the theory of the reaction-wheel inverted pendulum problem, we turn to a couple of actual hardware implementations of similar problems that are documented online. In 2016, Ben Katz posted a blog about the process of building a Furuta Pendulum from scratch. This featured an inverted pendulum, but instead of controlling the $x$ coordinate of the base of the pendulum, the control is in the form of another rotational axis on which the pendulum is attached orthogonally. Thus, by rotating the system rapidly in the $x, y$ plane, stability in the $z$ plane can be achieved.\\ \indent
In 2013, Spanlang, Mayr, and Gattringer of the Institute of Robotics at Johannes Kepler University Linz (Austria) built a reaction-wheel inverted pendulum contained within a 18x18x18 cm cube, using the floor as the base of the pendulum. \\ \indent
Finally, in 2012, Shane Colton build the Seg Stick at MITERS (the machine shope we build our project in). The Seg Stick is a self-balancing broomstick powered by two drill-driven wheels at the base of the stick. It has the functionality of the cart-pole system, but less constrained, and with the ability to move the system while balancing. In section IV, we further discuss the possibilities of adding a similar feature to our reaction-wheel inverted pendulum system.

%Control authority analysis -- max torque output as function of motor and flywheel (torque constraints)
%Compare to mglsin theta -- what is the maximum deviation angle we can recover from
\section{Hardware Methods}
To constrain our reaction wheel inverted pendulum, we constructed a wooden jig that holds a spinning shaft in place with two ball bearings. The shaft (functioning as the base of the pendulum) is fixed to the plastic lever at the end of which the flywheel and motor are mounted. An encoder is press-fit into the shaft at the base of the pendulum, which gives us our $\theta_1$ value. To further minimize the escaping of the system's energy through means other than rotation, the system is clamped down. We used an Arduino Uno for electronics and code.\\ \indent
As with any hardware project, it took multiple iterations to arrive at a sufficiently-controllable prototype. The first iteration used a printer motor, and a solid aluminum flywheel with about 4 inches in diameter.  After experimenting with trying to control the pendulum with this setup, it became apparent that the flywheel needed more inertia. \\ \indent
After adding more weight and a slight increase in diameter to the flywheel, we experimented further. A higher swingup was able to be commanded by this improvement, but we needed a motor with more torque, because the motor required an unnecessarily long ramp down in speed before switching directions.\\ \indent 
Our third and final iteration featured a flywheel with a much larger diameter and weight distributed more on the perimeter, and a large upgrade to a drill motor with significantly more torque (available from harbor freight). These vast increases in both torque and inertia finally allowed the system to command the acceleration necessary for a full swingup.

\subsection{Theory to Reality}

Later in the paper, we will explain the LQR theory. In reality, however, we relied on PD
control. The reasons for this are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Limited torque output. Even though our final motor brought a significant increase in torque, it was still far from the ideal (part of this was due to the flywheel's relatively large mass). For full controllability, we'd want a motor with enough torque to be able to handle rapid direction switching at high angular velocities.
    \item Lack of motor encoder. Though our first motor had an attached encoder, it did not have nearly enough torque, so we had to upgrade. Unfortunately, the newer drill motor did not have an attached encoder, so we lost the ability to track $\theta_2$. $\dot{\theta}$, and $\ddot{\theta}_2$ accurately. Naturally, losing those state variables resulted in a decrease in controllability. 
    \item Lack of current control. The software controller we wrote outputs torque, but
    we do not command torque directly (the motor interface only takes angular velocity as input), and needed to write an inner PID loop  (TODO: Nao. I
    can fill this in)
\end{itemize}


\textbf{To calculate the state variables}, 
We have discrete digital values from the quadrature encoder on the shaft, which
was a high quality one (1025 counts).

We furthermore use a naive method to estimate angular velocities from the
encoder counts: measure time elapsed and the change in angle, divide, set as our
thetadot.

(Non constant time frame)

\subsection{Swingup with Bang-Bang Control}
To get an initial working implementation to swing the pendulum up to 180 degrees, we used a simple bang-bang controller. The protocol is as follows. When $\theta_1 > 0$ and $\dot{\theta}_1$, run the motor at full speed clockwise to maximize the amplitude reached. When the apex of that period is reached (i.e. $\dot{\theta}_1 = 0$), run the motor at full speed in the opposite direction. Essentially, run the motor at full speed in whatever direction is consistent with the pendulum's direction of travel, w.r.t. the overall system. If the pendulum is moving clockwise, spin clockwise. If the pendulum is moving counterclockwise, spin counterclockwise. Using this bang-bang controller, we were able to achieve full swingup.\\ \indent
To make the swingup more efficient, we implemented a more complex controller, utilizing energy shaping (covered in section III F).
\subsection{Inversion with PD Control}
For downward convergence, we used a simple Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller with two k values: one for $\theta_1$, and one for $\dot{\theta_1}$. Our feedback for motor output was formulated by: $$\textrm{motor output = } - ceil(k(\theta_1-\theta_{1d})-k_d (\dot{\theta}_1-\theta_{1dotd}))$$ where $k$ and $k_d$ represent the proportional and derivative constants, respectively, $\theta_{1d}$ represents the desired $\theta_1$ value (0.0), and $\theta_{1dotd}$ the desired $\dot{\theta}_1$ value (0.0). To choose our $k$ constants, we used added a potentiometer to our arduino setup, for easy, on-the-go tuning. 

\subsection{Results}
To quantify the efficacy of our controller, we timed multiple different tasks for both our first iteration (with the smaller flywheel and weaker motor), and our final iteration (with the larger flywheel and stronger motor). The tasks we timed were natural downward convergence (how long the pendulum takes to converge at 0 deg when started at 90 deg, without any control input), controlled downward convergence (how long the pendulum takes to converge at 0 deg when started at 90 deg, with control input), and controlled swingup (how long it takes for the pendulum to swing up to 180 deg). These findings are displayed in Table I.

\section{Simulation Analysis}

\subsection{Equations of Motion}

To derive the equations of motion (EOM), we use the Lagrangian method. Let $L$
equal to the kinetic energy plus the potential energy of the system.


\begin{align}
    L = KE - PE
\end{align}

By Lagrange's method,

\begin{align}
    \frac{d}{dt} (\frac{\partial{L}}{\partial \dot{q}_i}) -
    \frac{\partial{L}}{\partial q_i}  &= \sum_{i=0}^{n} F_i
\end{align}

for $i = 1,2,3 ... n $ forces.

Thus, we need to write out the KE, the PE, the derivative of L with respective
to each state $q$, the derivative of L with respect to the (time) derivative of
each state $q$, and then the time derivative of that last term.

Let us first consider the unaltered case, from the problem set, where here we
will derive the equations of motion by hand but otherwise simply explain the
derivation in detail. Later, we will consider a system that more closely matches
our real-life system. We will not be able to compare the model with reality,
since we were unable to implement the full state measurement so LQR cannot
apply. Instead, we show another example as applied to a modified system where
the reaction wheel pendulum is put on an (unpowered) cart.


\noindent 1) \textbf{Write the KE of the system}. We can decompose this into the translational and
rotational components.

First, let us consider (abstractly) the translational KE of a point mass $m$ rotating
around the origin on a massless string of length $l$. $\theta$ is defined as
angle from the downward vertical point, increasing counterclockwise  (diagram not provided).
The position of the point mass is $x = l cos \theta$ and $y = l sin \theta$.
KE is $\frac{1}{2} m \cdot q^2$, where q is the position.

% http://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/underactuated.html?chapter=multibody
\begin{align}
    KE_x &= 0.5 m (l \cdot \frac{d}{dt} \sin \theta)^2 = \frac{1}{2} m (l \dot\theta \cos \theta)^2 \\
    KE_y &= 0.5 m (l \cdot \frac{d}{dt} \cos \theta)^2  = \frac{1}{2} m (- l \dot\theta \sin\theta)^2 \\
    KE &= KE_x + KE_y = \frac{1}{2} m l^2 \dot \theta^2 (\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta) \\
       &= \frac{1}{2} m l^2 \dot\theta^2 \\
\end{align}

where on the last step we used the trig identity $\cos^2 + sin^2 = 1$.

Now applying this to the stick and flywheel components of our system, we
calculate 1) the stick around the origin 2) the flywheel around the origin. Note
that the KE of the stick acts at $l_1$, the center-of-mass of the stick, not
$l_2$.

\begin{align}
    KE_{\text{translational}} &= \frac{1}{2} m_1 (l_1 \dot\theta_1)^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 (l_2 \dot\theta_1)^2\\
\end{align}

Additionally we have the inertial component of KE since we have angular
velocities here and our stick has mass and our previous point mass is instead a rotating
flywheel. The general formula is $KE = \frac{1}{2} I_2 \dot\theta^2$.
Noting that angular velocities "add", and applying this to each component of our
system; we calculate 1) inertial KE of the stick 2) inertial KE of the flywheel.
\begin{align}
    KE_{\text{inertial}} &= \frac{1}{2} I_1 \dot\theta_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}
    I_2 (\dot\theta_1 + \dot\theta_2)^2
\end{align}

The total KE of the system is the sum of the above.

\noindent 2) \textbf{Write the PE of the system}. This is more straightforward. Gravitationally
speaking, (and with a bit of geometry - note that our theta is defined from
vertical and increasing counterclockwise)
\begin{align}
    PE &= m_1 g (- l_1 \cos\theta_1) + m_2 g (- l_2 \cos\theta_1)
\end{align}

\noindent 3) Now we have the Lagrangian $L = KE - PE$ and must take the partial of the Lagrangian with
respect to each state variable, in our case $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$.

Using sympy (note: we left the sympy ordering intact, so the terms are a
bit weird), we calculate
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        -g l_1 m_1 \sin(\theta_1) - g l_2 m_2 \sin(\theta_1) \\
        0
    \end{bmatrix}
    \label{eq:partialq}
\end{align}

\noindent 4) As an intermediate step, we calculate the
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot q} &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        I_1 \dot\theta_1 + I_2 (\dot\theta_1 + \dot\theta_2) +
            l_1^2 m_1 \dot\theta_1 + l_2^2 m_2 \dot \theta_1 \\
            I_2 (\dot \theta_1 + \dot\theta_2)
    \end{bmatrix}
    \label{eq:partialqdot}
\end{align}

\noindent 5) Finally, we calculate the time derivative of the previous term
\begin{align}
    \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot q_i} &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
    I_2 \ddot\theta_2 + \ddot\theta_1 ( I_1 +  I_2 +  m_1 l_1^2 + m_2 l_2^2) \\
    I_2 \ddot\theta_1 + I_2 \ddot\theta_2
    \end{bmatrix}
    \label{eq:ddt}
\end{align}

\noindent 6) We set the equation equal, on the right hand side, to our input torque $\tau$.

We may then directly ask sympy to solve for $\ddot q$

\begin{align}
    \ddot \theta_1 &= -g \frac{ (m_1 l_1 + m_2 l_2) \sin(\theta_1)}
        {I_1 + m_1 l_1^2 + m_2 l_2^2} \\
    \ddot \theta_2 &= g \frac{ (m_1 l_1 + m_2 l_2) \sin(\theta_1) }
        {I_1 + m_1 l_1^2 + m_2 l_2^2}
\end{align}

More neatly, we can go directly from \cref{eq:ddt} and
\cref{eq:partialq} to the "manipulator equations" as per the class textbook.
Specifically, we put \cref{eq:ddt} on the left hand side, factoring out
$\ddot \theta_1$ and $\ddot \theta_2$; then on the right hand side we put
\cref{eq:partialq}, factoring out $\dot \theta_1$ and $\dot \theta_2$ as well as
adding in our input torque $\tau$.

That is, we rewrite in form

\begin{equation}
\bm{M(q) \ddot q + C (q, \dot q) \dot q = \tau_g (q) + B u}
\end{equation}

Doing so, we then get as given to us in the homework
(yay it matches!)

\begin{align}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        m_1 l_1 ^2 + m_2 l_2^2 + I_1 + I_2 & I_2 \\
        I_2 & I_2
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \ddot \theta_1 \\
        \ddot \theta_2
    \end{bmatrix}
    + 0
    &= \nonumber \\
    \begin{bmatrix}
        - (m_1 l_1 + m_2 l_2) g \sin\theta_1 \\
        0
    \end{bmatrix}
     +
     \begin{bmatrix}
         0 \\
         1
     \end{bmatrix}
     \tau
\end{align}


%\subsubsection{Motor vs Gravity}

%Tangentially, ideally our output torque is enough to fight gravity and
%essentially "hold" the pendulum floating in space at any angle, and the maximum
%torque is at horizontal ( $\theta_1 = \pi/2$ ).

%\begin{align}
    %\tau_{motor, max} &= 270 \; \text{Nm} \\
%\tau_{gravity, max} &= m g l sin\theta \\
%\tau_{gravity, max} &= m_{system} \cdot 9.8 \cdot 0.021 \cdot sin(\pi/2)\\
%\tau_{gravity, max} &= (.546 + .45 + .115/2 ) \cdot 9.8 \cdot 0.021 \cdot 1\\
%\tau_{gravity, max} &\approx .21 \; \text{Nm}
%\end{align}

%Where for back-of-envelope purposes we're approximating torque contribution of
%the stick.

%Here we easily see that our output torque does not approach this. A more
%useful analysis is to observe whether
%conservation of energy, we can conclude that for a closed system,

%\subsection{Find the Fixed Points}

%To find the fixed points of the system, we calculate $\dot q s.t. f(\dot q) = 0$

\subsection{Linearization Around Fixed Point}

We can further use sympy to linearize our fixed points.

Focusing on the upright case, we can use the approximation

\begin{align}
    \sin\theta \approx \pi - \theta \text{ for } \theta \approx \pi
\end{align}

For the downward case, we can similarly use the approximation

\begin{align}
    \sin\theta \approx \theta \text{ for } \theta \approx 0
\end{align}

% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system#Pendula
% TODO: push sympy code
After plugging in to sympy, we get 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, frame=single]
t1ddot= -g*(l1*m1 + l2*m2)*sin(t1)/(I1 + l1**2*m1 + l2**2*m2)
t2ddot= g*(l1*m1 + l2*m2)*sin(t1)/(I1 + l1**2*m1 + l2**2*m2)
\end{lstlisting}

Or written in Latex,
\begin{align}
    \ddot \theta_1 &= -g \frac{(m_1 l_1 + m_2 l_2) \sin(\theta_1) } 
    {I_1 + m_1 l_1^2 + m_2 l_2^2)} \\
    \ddot \theta_2 &= g \frac{(m_1 l_1 + m_2 l_2) \sin(\theta_1) } 
    {I_1 + m_1 l_1^2 + m_2 l_2^2)}
\end{align}


This can be rewritten to be the same result as in the homework, where we
substitute in the approximation around $\theta = \pi$

\begin{align}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \dot\theta_1 \\
        \dot\theta_2 \\
        \ddot\theta_1 \\
        \ddot\theta_2
    \end{bmatrix}
    =&
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
        \frac{(m_1 l_1 + m_2 l_2) g}{(m_1 l_1^2 + m_2 l_2^2 + I_1)} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        - \frac{(m_1 l_1 + m_2 l_2) g}{(m_1 l_1^2 + m_2 l_2^2 + I_1)}  & 0 & 0 & 0
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \theta_1 - 180 \\
        \theta_2 \\
        \dot{\theta_1} \\
        \dot{\theta_2}
    \end{bmatrix} \nonumber \\
    &+
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0 \\
        0 \\
        \frac{-1}{(m_1 l_1^2 + m_2 l_2^2 + I_1)} \\
        \frac{1}{I_2} + \frac{1}{(m_1 l_1^2 + m_2 l_2^2 + I_1)}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \tau \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{A and B}

If we plug in the measurements from our physical system as in
\cref{tbl:systemparameters}, we get the following A and B matrices (rounded).

\begin{align}
    A &= 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
        312 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        -312  & 0 & 0 & 0
    \end{bmatrix} \\
    B &=  
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0 \\
        0 \\
        -1395\\
        1901
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
%originally A is  5 -5. and B is -0.1 11

Note: We treat the stick mass as negligible compared the motor, which is
modelled as a point mass at distance $l_2$; thus we set $l_1$ equal to $l_2$,
and $m_1$ = $m_{motor}$.

\subsection{Applying LQR}

Now that we have $A$ and $B$, the matrices for our linearized dynamics of form
$f(x) = Ax + Bu$, we supply our Q and R cost functions and apply lqr. We care a
lot about the $\theta_1$, some about the $\dot\theta_1$, a bit about
$\dot\theta_2$, and not at all about $\theta_2$.  We also put a cost on the
input using $\textbf{R}$(here we closely follow the
assignment, since it turns out we will not be able to apply LQR to our physical
system).
%% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
%% TODO ! change the inertia matrix and redo these numbers
%% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
%% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{align}
    Q &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        10 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0.1
    \end{bmatrix}\\
    R &= \begin{bmatrix} 0.1 \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

Using the LQR function built into Drake, we get (rounded)

\begin{align}
    K &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        -35 & 0 & -5 & -1 \\
    \end{bmatrix}\\
    S &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        12 & 0 & 1  & 0. \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        1 & 0 & 0. & 0. \\
        0. & 0 & 3 & 0.
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

where K is our control matrix, operating on each of the four states ($q =
\theta_1, \theta_2, \dot \theta_1, \dot \theta_2$); and S is the solution of the
Ricatti equation.

% TODO: explore this S matrix further!!!
% Define what is the associated Ricatti equation

\subsection{Region of Attraction via Lyapunov}

We will briefly cover the region of attraction (RoA) analysis, which is covered
in the problem set already. For an LQR controller, which uses a linearization of
underlying nonlinear dynamics, this analysis tells us the region for which the
linearization is valid (where our LQR control can be used). 

Specifically, we will use Lyapunov analysis. Lyapunov analysis is a relaxed
optimization guarantee -- instead of guaranteeing an controller optimal for all
states will be found, we instead guarantee a controller will be able to
accomplish a given state. 

With the LQR controller, which operates as a constant matrix times the 
state error (from the desired fixed point)

\begin{align}
    u &= - K(x_{\text{measured}} - x_{\text{fixed point}})
\end{align}

We denote the error as $\bar x = x - x_{fp}$. For our Lyapunov function, we can use the cost-to-go of the LQR solution 

\begin{align}
    V_{\text{cost-to-go}} &= \bar x^T S \bar x
\end{align}

% TODO definte lyapunov function
where $S$ is as return to us by the Drake LQR solver. This S is the solution to
the Ricatti equation (a randomly fancy name for a first order quadratic
differential equation); in steady-state, this becomes an algebriac Ricatti
equation.

Note that in performing this analysis we picked a single known
reasonble Lyapunov function. Other functions are possible, which would give
slightly different regions of attraction for the same LQR controller.

% TODO: go more into this?

The value of this function, for a given state, can then be used to bound where
our linear controls will work. In our controller, we simply check the value of
$V$ for the state we are in and compare it to this bound. If we are within the
region of attraction, we use the LQR controller. Otherwise, we use the 
swing-up controller described in the following section.

\subsection{Energy-based Controller for Swingup}

% http://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/underactuated.html?chapter=acrobot
The idea behind the energy-based swingup controller is straightforward: we add
torque in the direction that the magnitude of $\theta_1$ is increasing in. We
care to increase $\theta_1$. However, we cannot directly control $\theta_1$, but
instead apply torque to control $\theta_2$. (In jargon, this is called
"non-collocated input").

For the simple pendulum, we observed 

\begin{align}
    \dot E &= u \dot \theta
\end{align}

For our system, we rederive $\dot E$ accounting for the fact that our input is
now non-collocated.

We actually desire $\dot E$ to be zero, since our $E$ will be at steady-state,
thus our energy error is directly $\dot E$. We then derive what u must be to
drive this to zero.

% TODO

In the end, in the actual sytem, a bang-bang controller was sufficient.
Additionally, as the derivation is already covered in the homework, we will not
repeat it here.

\subsection{Controllability}

This is again covered in the homework and will not be derived here.

The existence of multiple examples online would show that this system is
generally theoretically controllable, even given torque limits. 

In our case, we can also more directly consider a quick-and-dirty calcuation:
what is maximum torque produced by gravity, compared to the maximum torque our
motor can generate? Additionally, in reality the flywheel will also saturate at
some max speed of the motor, past which back EMF will limit the speed of the
flywheel. This strongly impacts the difficulty of controlling our system. 

This analyses is omitted, as the results didn't quite match reality, and likely
would need to be tailored further for the non-idealities of our physical system.

% TODO

\subsection{Is it Underactuated?}

When talking to friends about this, one of the first questions asked was
invariable "is that really an underactuated system?" especially since we do not
care about $\theta_2$.

By the definition in the textbook, 
    A control system described by equation 1 is underactuated in state (q,q˙) at
    time t if it is not able to command an arbitrary instantaneous acceleration
    in q.
With the particular caveat that the same system could be technically be fully or underactuated at different moments in time.

\section{LQR for "System on Wheels"}

%https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-003sc-engineering-dynamics-fall-2011/lagrange-equations/MIT2_003SCF11_rec8notes1.pdf

For a detour (in order to demonstrate understanding of the problem set material)
we imagine sticking the whole thing on wheels and redo the same analysis,
although for sanity we run the calculations through sympy instead of by hand.
\cite{JS-aruco}


%\subsection{Controllability}

%We begin by analyzing the controllability of the system. At an intuitive level,
%we see that we've added a state (the x position of the cart) without adding any
%control inputs (we can still only control the flywheel directly). We might
%expect that we can still stabilize the system, but cannot control the cart
%position while keeping the pendulum upright (at least with LQR feedback).

%To check our intuition, we check the rank of the controllability matrix, defined as

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Discussion}

1) estimate motor velocity: if we wanted to, we could do it from current

It does seem from online that it's possible to stabilize with this estimate
(link to youtube video)

2) rebuild with less torque limited (maybe try this analysis again? I didn't get
it to work above -- skip if running out of time)




\subsection{Mechanical Lessons Learned}

Pressfits are great! They’re used for… everything.
Decisiveness is good – we weren’t certain about going for the better motor, which instinctually thought it’d be needed but went for it and glad we did.
Glad we gave some consideration to clearance – bigger motor and flwheel barely fit (scrapes the staples).
Maybe would go back to 3d printed version
Current control


\section{Future Work and Conclusion}

We got it to invert!
In the future, LQR ... :'( 
But for simple systems like this inverted pendulum (and not humanoids) PD is
plenty, don't need LQR really.
And then... stick it on wheels! -- however this version will likely be 3d
printed...
