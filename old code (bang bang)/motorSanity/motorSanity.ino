 * This project demonstrates how to include and 
 * instantiate a new MegaMoto object with the 
 * chosen pinassignments and then start up the 
 * motor/device in various speeds and directions.

// Include the MegaMoto library
#include <MegaMotoHB.h>

// Instantiate a (global) MegaMoto object.
// For this example, it is assumed that your jumpers are connected in
// the following fashion. Please read page 3 in the MegaMoto user
// manual to understand your options. ALSO, the motor itself is wired
// in an H-bridge fashion. Please see Figure 4 on page 5 of the user
// manual to understand what this means.
// 
// -- Jumper configuration --
// PWM A ---> D11
// PWM B ---> D3
// Enable --> 5V
// Sensor --> (none. remove jumper)

// Format is:  <yourObjectName>( <pin_for_pwm_a>, <pin_for_pwm_b> );
/*MegaMotoHB motor(11, 10);*/

// If you *do* want to use the Enable line, instantiate your motor
// object like this...
// Format is:  <yourObjectName>( <pin_for_pwm_a>, <pin_for_pwm_b>, <pin_for_enable> );

MegaMotoHB motor(11, 10, 8);

void setup() 
{
	// Initialize the serial port
	Serial.begin(9600);
    
	// Print a message indicating the code is running
	Serial.println("Basic MegaMoto test is running...");
	
	// Enable the MegaMoto controller, if you *did* choose to
	// control the Enable pin. If you didn't use the Enable pin,
	// this function won't do anything. It's just wasting your
	// CPU time, so comment it out! ;-)
//	motor.Enable();

}


void loop()
{
    // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

    // Move forward at full speed
    motor.Fwd(255);

    // Wait for 1 second
    delay(1000);

    // Move backward at half speed
    motor.Rev(128);

    // Wait for 1 second
    delay(1000);

    // Stop the device (with 'ramping')
    motor.Stop();

    // Wait for 1 second
    delay(1000);
}
